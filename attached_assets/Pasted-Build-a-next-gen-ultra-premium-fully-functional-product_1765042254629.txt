Build a next-gen, ultra-premium, fully functional, production-ready Hostel Management System FRONTEND ONLY using:

TECH STACK
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Framer Motion
- React Three Fiber / Three.js (subtle depth only)
- Recharts for analytics
- Axios-ready API layer (no real backend calls)

STRICT DOMAIN MODEL
- Hostel consists of EXACTLY 4 blocks:
  - Block A
  - Block B
  - Block C
  - Block D
- Each block has EXACTLY 1 dedicated warden.
- Admin manages all 4 blocks and all wardens.
- Each student belongs to:
  - ONE block
  - ONE room
- Each warden can access ONLY their own block’s data.
- Attendance can be marked ONLY by the respective block warden.

STUDENT ID RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)
- When Admin registers a student, the system MUST:
  - Auto-generate a unique Student ID Number (example: HSTL2025A001)
  - Store and display this Student ID EVERYWHERE:
    - Student tables
    - Search
    - Filters
    - Profile drawer
    - Attendance lists
    - Fee records
    - Visitor logs
    - Complaint details
- Student ID must be the PRIMARY identifier in UI.

DESIGN GOAL
- Premium SaaS-level UI
- Dark-first luxury theme
- Glassmorphism with solid readable surfaces
- NO fully transparent forms or modals
- Smooth Framer Motion animations
- Soft 3D depth only (NO gaming style)
- Fully responsive & mobile optimized

ROLES & ACCESS (STRICT RBAC)
- Admin → Full control
- Warden → Block-level control only
- Student → Personal access only
Each role MUST be technically restricted in UI navigation and actions.
